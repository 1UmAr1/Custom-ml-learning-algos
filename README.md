# Custom-ml-learning-algos
Created some custom algorithm to get better understanding of these algorithms

In this repository i have created machine learning algorithms from scratch. and data used for testing the algorithms is (brest-cencer-wisconsin) and hour price prediction which are available on kaggle

Algorithms created
1). Custom K neighrest neighbours
2). Custom Mean Shift algorithm
3). Custom Support Vector Machine
4). Custom K Means algorithm
5). Linear Regression

I have also used the algorithms from sklearn to compare my custom made algorithms with those in sklearn library
